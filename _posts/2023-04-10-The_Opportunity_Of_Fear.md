Have you ever had a goal you wanted to reach but were afraid to take the necessary steps to achieve it? ðŸ¤”

Perhaps you're putting off trying something you've always wanted to do because you're afraid of failing. Maybe you didn't express your idea in a conversation because you were afraid of being ridiculed. Or perhaps you're holding back from doing what you want because you're worried it won't be accepted by those around you.

Fear is a powerful emotion that can hold us back from achieving our dreams. It's a barrier that needs to be defined and understood.

But what if I told you that fear could be a good thing?

If you're afraid of something, it means you haven't developed the skills to deal with it. Changing this situation and gaining the ability to face it is possible for everyone, just like anyone else in the world.

When you discover something you're afraid of, I suggest that the first thing you think is:

AHA! I'm afraid of something and I'm running away from it. There is an invisible dragon here. If there's a dragon, there must be a treasure behind it.

Whatever we are avoiding holds some kind of treasure. If you can face that dragon (which exists in your mind and often seems strange to others ðŸ¤­), you can reach the treasure it's guarding.

Some dragons are so big and scary that they're unimaginable to the people who see them. No matter what your mind tells you, you have to believe in the existence of small steps you can take. If starting to do what you dream of seems infinitely scary and difficult, you can only think that you have done it. You can allow yourself to get used to this process by taking only the first step every day.

If you deny the existence of the dragon or continue to run away from it every time you see it, a treasure you will never taste will smile at you from afar throughout your life.

On the contrary, chasing the treasure with small steps will create a real adventure in your life. ðŸ›³

Here, let's share a small note. Most people do not want security with completely defined boundaries. They want an adventure that is challenging enough for them to cope with.

In that adventure, being brave and developing capacity to discover the meaning of more responsibility will make you a mind that continues to grow.

...

You already know how to do the things you know how to do.

Under the emotion of fear are the things that are uncomfortable, pressing, and uncertain that you don't know how to do.

And of course, learning these things will be difficult.

"But to see that you're improving every day, to continue creating evidence to trust yourself more is invaluable. The benefits of this are seen by you, your loved ones, and all of humanity.

...

I felt the need to put this into writing as I came across this idea late. A key to unlocking a locked room in your mind.

I wonder, which dragons will you discover on your journey? ðŸ™‚"
